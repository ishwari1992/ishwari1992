Conclusion
In this example, we created a toggle switch using only HTML and CSS. Here's how it works:

HTML: Defines the structure with a checkbox input for the toggle and a div for the content to be toggled.
CSS: Styles the toggle switch to make it look like a typical ON/OFF switch and manages the visibility of the content.
The toggle switch is styled with a slider class that changes appearance when the checkbox is checked (input:checked + .slider).
The content to be toggled is initially hidden (display: none) and becomes visible when the checkbox is checked (#toggle-input:checked ~ #toggle-content).
